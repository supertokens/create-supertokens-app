# SuperTokens + Go (net/http)

A demo implementation of [SuperTokens](https://supertokens.com/) with Golang's [net/http package](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http). Based on a standard Go project structure.

## General Info

This project aims to demonstrate how to integrate SuperTokens into a Go (net/http) backend application. Its primary purpose is to serve as an educational tool, but it can also be used as a starting point for your own project.

## Repo Structure

### Source

```

```

## Config

### SuperTokens

The full configuration needed for SuperTokens (the backend part) to work is in the `config.go` file. This file will differ based on the [auth recipe](https://supertokens.com/docs/guides) you choose.

If you choose to use this as a starting point for your own project, you can further customize the options and config in the `config.go` file. Refer to our [docs](https://supertokens.com/docs) (and make sure to choose the correct recipe) for more details.

## Application Flow

When using SuperTokens, the front-end never calls directly to the SuperTokens Core, the service that creates and manages sessions. Instead, the front-end calls to the back-end and the back-end calls to the Core. You can read more about [how SuperTokens works here](https://supertokens.com/docs/thirdpartyemailpassword/architecture).

The back-end has two main files:

1.  **Entry Point (`main.go`)**

    -   Initializes SuperTokens
    -   Adds CORS headers for sessions with the front-end
    -   Adds SuperTokens middleware
    -   Endpoints:
        -   `/hello`: Public route not protected by SuperTokens
        -   `/sessioninfo`: Uses SuperTokens middleware to pull the session token off the request and get the user session info
        -   `/tenants`: Grabs a list of tenants for multitenant configured applications

2.  **Configuration (`config.go`)**
    -   `supertokensConfig`:
        -   `supertokens`:
            -   `connectionURI`: Sets the URL that your SuperTokens core is located. By default, it connects to the playground core. In production, you can [host your own core](https://supertokens.com/docs/thirdpartyemailpassword/pre-built-ui/setup/core/with-docker) or create an account to [enable managed hosting](https://supertokens.com/dashboard-saas)
        -   `appInfo`: Holds information like your project name
            -   `apiDomain`: Sets the domain your back-end API is on. SuperTokens automatically listens to create requests at `${apiDomain}/auth`
            -   `websiteDomain`: Sets the domain your front-end website is on
        -   `recipeList`: An array of recipes for adding supertokens features

## Customizing SuperTokens Behavior

You can customize the behavior of the SuperTokens SDK by adjusting the configuration in `config.go` and by implementing custom logic within your API endpoints. Refer to the [SuperTokens backend SDK documentation](https://supertokens.com/docs/backend/override/built-in-ui) for advanced customizations like overriding API interfaces or logic.
