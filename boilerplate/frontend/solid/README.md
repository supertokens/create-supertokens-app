# SuperTokens + SolidJS

A demo implementation of [SuperTokens](https://supertokens.com/) with [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/). Based on [Vite](https://vite.dev/).

## General Info

This project aims to demonstrate how to integrate SuperTokens into a SolidJS application. Its primary purpose is to serve as an educational tool, but it can also be used as a starting point for your own project.

## Config

### Vite

Given that the project is a standard Vite project, everything available in the [Vite configuration docs](https://vite.dev/config/) is available to use here (refer to the `vite.config.ts` file). The only customization we've done is changing the port to `3000`.

### SuperTokens

The full configuration needed for SuperTokens (the frontend part) to work is in the `src/config.ts` file. This file will differ based on the [auth recipe](https://supertokens.com/docs/guides) you choose.

If you choose to use this as a starting point for your own project, you can further customize the options and config in the `src/config.ts` file. Refer to our [docs](https://supertokens.com/docs) (and make sure to choose the correct recipe) for more details.

## Application Flow

The application uses [@solidjs/router](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-router) for routing and consists of five main parts:

1.  **Entry Point (`main.tsx`)**

    -   Initializes the SolidJS application
    -   Renders the main `App` component

2.  **Root Component (`App.tsx`)**

    -   Initializes SuperTokens with the provided configuration (generated by the CLI)
    -   Sets up the routing structure using `@solidjs/router`
    -   Wraps the application with necessary providers
    -   Defines three main routes:
        -   `/`: Public landing page - accessible regardless of auth state
        -   `/auth`: Renders SuperTokens' pre-built auth UI - accessible regardless of auth state
        -   `/dashboard`: Protected route requiring authentication

3.  **Auth Component (`Auth.tsx`)**

    -   Handles the authentication routes and UI
    -   Integrates with SuperTokens' pre-built auth UI
    -   Manages the authentication flow

4.  **Home Component (`/` route, `/Home/index.tsx` component)**

    -   Public landing page accessible to all users
    -   Provides navigation to authentication and dashboard
    -   Serves as the entry point for new users

5.  **Dashboard Component (`/dashboard` route, `/Dashboard/index.tsx` component)**
    -   Protected route only accessible to authenticated users
    -   Protected by session verification
    -   Displays user information and provides authenticated functionality

When a user visits the application, they start at the home page (`/`). They can choose to authenticate through the `/auth` route, and once authenticated, they gain access to the protected dashboard. The session state is managed throughout the application using SuperTokens' session management.

## Customizations

If you want to customize the default auth UI, you have two options:

1. Refer to the [docs](https://supertokens.com/docs/thirdpartyemailpassword/advanced-customizations/react-component-override/usage) on how to customize the pre-built UI. (Note: While this link is for React, many concepts may apply. Check for SolidJS specific documentation if available.)
2. Roll your own UI by choosing "Custom UI" in the right sidebar in the [docs](https://supertokens.com/docs/thirdpartyemailpassword/quickstart/frontend-setup).
